In order to better show my projects and enhance myself professionally speaking, it was necessary for me to create a portfolio.
However, a portfolio can be quite painful to maintain ... And for that I have set up a dynamic system allowing to recover all my Github projects and display them on my portfolio.
As you will surely be able to see if you consult the latter, I have many computer skills, especially in web development, and I therefore implemented them in order to offer a professional and dynamic portfolio.
The main technology used is Reactjs, which is a JavaScript framework which allows you to decompose the creation of our website with small reusable and modular code blocks.
To find out more about me, I invite you to consult my portfolio at this address: https://killianmathias.fr.
